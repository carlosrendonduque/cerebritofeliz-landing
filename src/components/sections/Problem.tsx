          <PainDescription>
            Traditional flashcards and courses feel like punishment. They're boring, 
            repetitive, and designed for passive consumption instead of active learning.

            Most learning platforms treat everyone the same. They can't adapt to your 
            learning style, pace, or current skill level, wasting your precious time.

            You memorize concepts but struggle to apply them. There's a huge disconnect
